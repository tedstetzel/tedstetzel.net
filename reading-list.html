			<h2>Reading List</h2>
			
			<p>After working in the printing and publishing industry for 4 years, I decided to make the jump to web development in 2008. Several of the newer hires/digital project managers at the agency I worked at wanted to make a similar transition and asked me what books/websites I recommend.</p>
		
		<ul class="bookList">
		
		<li><a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first" class="bookTitle">Mobile First <span class="author">by Luke Wroblewski</span></a> 
		
		<p>I've always preferred to know why I'm learning something before I learn it. Understanding the concept of Mobile First separates the people who know what they are doing from those who don't. It's a quick read and all of the <em>A Book Apart</em> content is top-notch. Start here. </p>
		
		</li>
		
		
		<li><a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/" class="bookTitle">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites <span class="author">by Jon Duckett</span></a> 
		
		<p>A classic that is extremely well designed and to the point. A great place to start learning HTML if you don't have a technical background.</p>
		
		</li>
		
		
		
		<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Web-Standards-3rd-Edition/dp/0321616952" class="bookTitle">Designing with Web Standards <span class="author">by Jeffrey Zeldman</span></a> 
		
		<p>Another know why before you learn type book that every web developer should have. Zeldman is the person who inspired two of my former co-workers who really got me into web development. We used to go as far as to buy blue beanies for everyone at work every <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/category/blue-beanie-day/">November 30th.</a></p>
		
		</li>
		
		
		<li><a href="http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfsd/" class="bookTitle">Head First Software Development <span class="author">by Dan Pilone, Russ Miles</span></a> 
		
		<p>I really liked the Head First Series when I was starting out since they are written in the same extremely pragmatic manner. The Software Development book is getting a little old but it is still a solid introduction on how to do things the right way (e.g. Agile methods, SDLC, test driven development). The <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010906.do">Head First HTML book</a> is also a good supplement for learning CSS and HTML syntax.</p>
